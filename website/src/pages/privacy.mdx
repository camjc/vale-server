# Privacy

Privacy is an important consideration in all Vale-related development decisions. We've gone to great lengths to ensure that our software has the utmost respect for our users and their content.

## Vale (CLI)

The [Vale command-line tool][1] serves as the foundation (functionality-wise) for all of our software and services. It's free, open source, and [permissively licensed][2].

Vale is distributed as a self-contained, standalone binary, and it works entirely **offline**: We have absolutely **zero** access to any content linted by Vale.

## Vale Server

[Vale Server][3] is graphical user interface (GUI), web-based dashboard, and HTTP server built on top of Vale.

It runs on [`localhost`][4] and uses a local `vale` executable to perform all of its linting, so it also inherits all of Vale's content-related privacy guarantees.

The only remote communication performed by Vale Server is a license key validation step done at start up. See its [Privacy Policy][6] and [Terms of Service][7] for more information.

## Vale Studio

[Vale Studio][5] is a [Heroku-hosted][8] web application. All content submitted through the application is sent to a server to be processed by a remotely-hosted `vale` executable.

Submissions are limited to 500 characters and are not accessed, analyzed, or stored for any purpose.

## `errata.ai`

The websites `errata.ai` and `docs.errata.ai` are completely free of ads, analytics, tracking, and
non-essential cookies.
