Vale is "syntax aware," which means that it's capable of both applying
rules to and ignoring certain sections of text. This functionality is
implemented through a _scoping_ system. A scope is specified through a
_selector_ such as `paragraph.rst`, which indicates that the rule applies to
all paragraphs in reStructuredText files. Here are a few examples:

* `comment` matches all source code comments;
* `comment.line` matches all source code line comments;
* `heading.md` matches all Markdown headings; and
* `text.html` matches all HTML scopes.

## Types, formats, and scopes

Vale classifies files into one of three types&mdash;`markup`, `code`, or
`text`&mdash;that determine what scopes are available.

Within each type, there can be multiple supported *formats*&mdash;such as
Markdown and AsciiDoc under `markup`. Since each format has access to the same
scopes, rules are compatible across all formats within a particular type.
