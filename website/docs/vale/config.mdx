The `.vale.ini` file is where you'll control the majority of Vale's behavior,
including what files to lint and how to lint them.

## Options

The `.vale.ini` file is [INI-formatted](https://ini.unknwon.io/docs/intro) and
consists of three sections: core settings, format associations, and
format-specific settings:

```ini title=".vale.ini"
# Core settings appear at the top
# (the "global" section).

[formats]
# Format associations appear under
# the optional "formats" section.

[*]
# Format-specific settings appear
# under a user-provided "glob"
# pattern.
```

### Core settings

<Core />

### Format associations

Format associations allow you to associate an "unknown" file extension with
a supported [file format](scoping):

```ini
[formats]
mdx = md
```

In the example above, we're telling Vale to treat MDX files as Markdown files.

### Format-specific settings

<Syntax />

## Search process

:::info Heads up!
You can override the default search process by manually specifying a path using
the [`--config`](/vale/cli#--config) option.

For example, if you'd like to use the XDG standard, you can reference the
relevant environment variable:

```bash
$ vale --config="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vale/vale.ini"
```

:::

Vale expects its configuration to be in a file named `.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`.
It'll start looking for this file in the same folder as the file that's
being linted. If it can't find one, it'll search up to 6 levels up the
file tree. After 6 levels, it'll look for a global configuration file in the OS equivalent of `$HOME` \(see below\).

| OS      | Search Locations                                     |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `$HOME`, `%UserProfile%`, or `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` |
| macOS   | `$HOME`                                              |
| Linux   | `$HOME`                                              |

If more than one configuration file is present, the closest one takes precedence.
