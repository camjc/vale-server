## Usage

After installation, the package will automatically activate on its specified formats: `text.md`, `source.gfm`, `text.restructuredtext`, `source.asciidoc`, `text.git-commit`, `text.plain`, and `text.plain.null-grammar` by default.

You can change these, in addition to other settings, in the package's Settings page:
