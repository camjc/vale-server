[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) is an open-source grammar checker
that has a [library of over 3,000 English rules](https://community.languagetool.org/rule/list?lang=en&offset=0&max=10).

Since Vale Server focuses (primarily) on writing style rather than grammatical
correctness, integrating with LanguageTool provides a nice balance of
functionality: Vale Server will enforce your style guide while LanguageTool
checks your grammar.

Additionally, by using this add-on, you also get to take advantage of Vale
Server's [understanding of markup](/vale-server/concepts/scoping)&mdash;which
LanguageTool lacks altogether on its own.

### Installation

The first step is to install
[LanguageTool's standalone desktop application](https://languagetool.org/#more).

After downloading and unzipping the `LanguageTool-x.x` folder, select your
installation location from Vale Server's extension preferences
(`Preferences -> Extensions`):

<AdaptiveImg
    alt="A screenshot of Vale Server's 'Extensions' page."
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/add-ons/LT/location')}
    format=".png">
</AdaptiveImg>

LanguageTool requires [Java 8 or later](https://www.java.com/en/download/). If
Java is already installed, it will show up under "Java" automatically. You can
also manually enter your own path to a `java` installation.

Once you have the required fields configured, click "Apply & Restart". If the
LanguageTool server started successfully, you'll see its URL displayed above the settings:

<AdaptiveImg
    alt="A screenshot of Vale Server's 'Extensions' page."
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/add-ons/LT/running')}
    format=".png">
</AdaptiveImg>

If you the LanguageTool server failed to start, see the `Server Log` option
from the context menu for more information.

### Usage

:::important
Currently, only rules listed in the `MISC`, `GRAMMAR`, `CONFUSED_WORDS`, and
`TYPOS` categories are enabled.
:::

Once LanguageTool is running in the background, you simply need to add
`LanguageTool` to your `BasedOnStyles` list in one of your projects:

<AdaptiveImg
    alt="A screenshot Vale Server's project management dialog."
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/add-ons/LT/config')}
    format=".png">
</AdaptiveImg>

You'll now see results from LanguageTool in our client plugins.

### Performance tuning

By default, Vale Server will give LanguageTool 2 seconds of processing time
before moving it to the background and showing its cached results on another
invocation (typically a file-save event in an editor).

You can increase this
value by providing another value for `ProcessTimeout` in your configuration
file:

<AdaptiveImg
    alt="A screenshot Vale Server's project management dialog."
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/add-ons/LT/timeout')}
    format=".png">
</AdaptiveImg>
