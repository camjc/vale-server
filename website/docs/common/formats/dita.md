:::info Heads up!
Due to the dependency on the third-party `dita` command,
you'll likely experience worse performance with DITA files compared to other formats.
:::

DITA is supported through the [DITA Open Toolkit](https://www.dita-ot.org/). You'll need to follow the [installation instructions](https://www.dita-ot.org/dev/topics/installing-client.html), including the optional step of adding the absolute path for the `bin` directory to the `PATH` system variable.

By default, `<codeblock>`, `<tt>`, and `<codeph>` elements are ignored.
