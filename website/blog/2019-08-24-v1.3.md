The past few months have been quite busy in terms of Vale and Vale Server development, I’ve released Vale v2.0.0-beta, Vale Server v1.2, and new versions of the Atom, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code clients.

Today I’m here to announce yet another new release, [Vale Server 1.3](https://errata.ai/vale-server/#puchase), which builds off of a bunch of work that’s been done with Vale v2.0.0 and the new text editor clients.

## LanguageTool Integration

While Vale Server is primarily concerned with enforcing certain [*writing styles](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles)*, the ability to provide grammar-related suggestions has been a popular feature request. v1.3 addresses this request by [integrating with LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool), an open-source grammar checker with [over 2,000 rules for English](https://community.languagetool.org/rule/list?lang=en).

The integration is seamless and all of your favorite Vale Server features will still work out-of-the-box: [After installing LanguageTool through the dashboard](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/ui#dashboard), you’ll have access to a new LanguageTool style that can be used like any other.

This will allow you to receive grammar suggestions across all of [Vale Server’s editor clients](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/usage#step-5-using-a-client-application), while still making use of Vale Server’s sophisticated [understanding of markup](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/format) (which LanguageTool doesn’t support on its own).

Here’s an example document showcasing some of the new rules:

## Rule Actions

The second major new feature in v1.3 is the ability to [fix style violations](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#actions) from within your favorite text editor (currently, VS Code, Atom, and Sublime Text are supported):

Style support for Rule Actions is still a work in progress, but LanguageTool, Microsoft, Vale, and Google have all been updated to make use of the new feature.

See the [Vale Server website](https://errata.ai/vale-server/#puchase) for more information. (Note: the latest features in v1.3 aren’t currently available in free trial builds.)
