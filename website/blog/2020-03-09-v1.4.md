I’m pleased to announce [v1.4 of Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/) today, the fourth major release of Vale’s desktop application. Development for v1.4 was almost entirely focused on improving the Dashboard, including the new *Studio* page.

## Vale Studio [beta]

One of Vale’s most popular features is its support for [YAML](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#overview)-based rules, which allow for a high degree of customization and extensibility without requiring any programming experience. The new *Studio* dashboard page leverages the machine-readable nature of these YAML files to offer a suite of validation and debugging tools.

### Validation

At the most basic level, Vale Studio will warn about “malformed” rules — such as those with YAML formatting errors or missing keys.

For each of the supported extension points (currently, [existence](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#existence), [substitution](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#substitution), [occurrence](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#occurrence), and [repetition](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#repetition)), Vale Studio will check that all required keys are defined and have valid values (where applicable).

### Testing

Assuming a rule passes the validation suite, its results will be shown in the right-hand editor panel:

This allows for rule creation and testing without needing to first configure the required components (`StylesPath`, `.vale.ini`, etc). And while only Markdown is currently supported, future releases will introduce support for all of Vale’s supported markup formats.

### regex101 Integration

Many of Vale’s [extension points](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#checks) are designed to provide a layer of abstraction over raw [regular expressions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), allowing for less boilerplate and more maintainable patterns. For example, consider the following substitution rule:

```yaml
extends: substitution
message: "Consider using '%s' instead of '%s'"
level: warning
ignorecase: false
# swap maps tokens in form of bad: good
swap:
  abundance: plenty
  accelerate: speed up
  accompany: go with
  address: discuss
  allocate: divide
```

Under the hood, Vale converts this YAML file into the following regular expression:

    \b(?:(accompany)|(address)|(allocate)|(abundance)|(accelerate))\b

Where the capture groups are used to associate a token (e.g., `accompany`) with its replacement (`go with`).

In general, this significantly improves the readability and maintainability of Vale’s rules. However, it can also make debugging a misbehaving rule more difficult since the actual pattern is a “hidden” implementation detail. Vale Studio attempts to address this issue by providing built-in integration with [regex101](https://regex101.com/), an online service for testing regular expression (which, importantly, supports [Go’s flavor](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)):

![A demonstration of Vale Studio’s regex101 integration.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tv10ms7Junp351wh5cySTA.gif)

Clicking the “regex101” button while developing a rule will open a new session with the correct settings and values (from Vale Studio).

## Going Forward

Vale Server’s new *Studio *page* *represents a significant improvement to Vale’s development workflow, but there’s still quite a bit of work to be done—future releases of Vale Server will include the following additions:

* Support for spelling rules, including regex101 integration for [filters](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/style#spelling) and auto-generated ignore files.

* Support for multi-pattern and exception-based rules (conditional, consistency, and capitalization).

* Support for importing, exporting, and saving Studio sessions.
